To run the application:

- cd into the directory.
- Install dependencies with 'npm install'
- You will need two separate terminals to run the frontend and the backend:
  
  For the frontend:
  - while in the Web_Dev_Final directory run 'npm run dev'
  
  For the backend:
  - cd into 'backend' directory
  - Also run 'npm install'
  - Then run 'npm run watch'

Once the backend and frontend are both running, ask questions and wait for chatGPT to talk to you :)
